# Explosion Sandbox

This is a pointless, yet fun simulation to play around with. Hold the left mouse button down to spawn particles with randomized radius and velocity. When a particle collides with the edge of the window, it will explode in an arc of smaller particles which are reflected back onto the pageâ€”each of which will eventually explode into *even smaller* particles, and so on, until they reach a minimum size.

Right click to tweak various parameters. Beware that if you spawn a lot of particles, the framerate will drop to a crawl and your fans will probably kick into overdrive. The "Explosion Particles" parameter, which controls how many smaller particles are spawned when a particle explodes, is particularly devious.
